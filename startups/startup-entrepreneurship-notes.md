# Startup Entrepreneurship Notes

## Ten things to consider before starting a startup

### 1. Articulate Your Purpose
- Video: ["Start With Why"](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en)
- Once you know your purpose, don’t spend any time wordsmithing it. Just write it down. This is your reason for being. Make sure everyone knows it, including the people you hire, your investors, your mentors, and your community.

### 2. Commit To At Least 10 Years

### 3. Get Family On Board

### 4. Define Your Culture
- Think carefully about what you want your culture to be and live it every day inside your business. Your culture can be defined as a set of values that you’ll always protect.
- Imagine a chart with performance on the X-axis and cultural fit on the Y-axis.  Moving someone along the X-axis if they’re not doing well is possible, but if they are not doing well on the Y-axis, then you have to move quickly to fire that person or the individual will compromise your culture.
- Firing people who are high performers and poor cultural fit is critical for maintaining culture over time and living your values.

### 5. Avoid Cofounder Conflict
- It is important for cofounders to discuss and agree on the following before starting a new business:
  - How should we split the equity?
  - How will decisions get made?
  - What happens if one of us leaves the company?
  - Can any of us be fired? By whom? For what reasons?
  - What are our personal goals for the startup?
  - Will this be the primary activity for each of us?
  - What part of our plan are we each unwilling to change?
  - What contractual terms will each of us sign with the company?
  - Will any of us be investing cash in this company? How will this be treated?
  - What will we be paid? How will this change over time and who will decide?
  - How will we fund the company and what happens if we can’t raise capital?

### 6. Assume You Are Wrong
- I’ve found that founders who start out assuming that they’re wrong end up doing the best. They recognize that all of their assumptions are just their best guesses. They are active listeners and are objective about the results they get early on. They test every assumption before accepting that it’s correct. They find ways to instrument their products so that they get data. Then they combine that with their gut feeling and intuition and test some more.

### 7. Engage Mentors
- I advise a quality-over-quantity approach when it comes to mentors. - Find a few experienced mentors who give first and ask for nothing in return.
- Blog Post: ["Find and Engage Great Mentors"](https://www.techstars.com/content/blog/tip-2-find-and-engage-great-mentors/)
- Start with small requests via email, close the loop with those who offer feedback, and make it easy to engage with you as a mentee by going to their office for 15 minutes instead of inviting them to coffee or lunch. Target mentors who actually care about you and what you’re building and leverage them early and often. But remember to give back to them and make sure they’re getting something from the relationship.

### 8. Establish The Company
- Consult an attorney early and pick one that is experienced with startups. A great question to ask them is how many companies they’ve worked with that have attracted venture capital.
  - They’ll help you understand what makes sense for you in terms of corporate structure and give you basic agreements you can use with early employees or contractors.

### 9. Understand Financing Options
- Startup loans
- Customer capital
  - Example: taking a $100,000 loan from a customer in order to deliver a free lifetime license to use our software in the future
- Angel capital and venture capital
  - Angels invest with their own money
  - Venture capitalists invest on behalf of their limited partners

### 10. Don’t Wait - Start
- The hardest thing about starting a startup is starting.
- There’s nothing like the clarity of doing.  So don’t wait.  Don’t find excuses.  Just start doing.

## Taking the plunge — from idea to incorporation

### Part I: Find Your Killer Idea (Product Concept)
- It is rare to fall in love with one idea immediately. Instead, you should focus on learning and getting feedback on a number of ideas.
- Use your early days of ideation as an opportunity to brainstorm with smart people you admire.

#### Anchor Around Your Super Powers
- Try to find some unfair advantage that you have over other teams and companies. Some founders are best suited to fix pain points they have faced in industries they know very well.
- If you’ve worked for large Fortune 500 companies and have access to channel partners or early product partnerships, those too can help provide some early advantage.

#### Look For Macro Tailwinds
- The goal is to be the winner in a massive market, but if you fall short of that goal, it is often better to be number three in a large market than number one in a medium or small market. Find your rising tide, your tailwind, or your hypergrowth market that is about to explode. It allows you to aim for the moon and still have a great outcome if you fall a bit short.
- Often opportunity can come from finding large markets that you know are undergoing massive upheaval and disruption.

#### Customer Feedback Pre-Product
- Getting advice from smart people in the field is important for idea generation, and then you refine it further by talking to real customer prospects. Many founders will build surveys and organize focus groups to get the feedback of at least 100+ customers for small medium businesses (SMBs) and dozens of prospects for enterprise products. You do not want to fire your rocket off in the wrong direction, so the more refinement you can do in the early days, the more efficient your efforts will be as you build real product.

#### Build A Prototype
- Early customer feedback on design mockups is helpful, but real user feedback on a real product is even better. This can be done through a minimum viable product (MVP) on the SMB/consumer side or a product pilot with a large enterprise that can help you build a product that is robust enough for enterprise players.

#### Iteration
- As with any early prototype, make sure you leave time for product iteration based on key customer feedback. Your first prototype should never be your last.

#### Product Value Proposition
- Make sure you are able to succinctly describe what your product does and why it is best suited to deliver on a particular value proposition. Know why your product can be much better than all other existing approaches and competitive products in the market and why this is valuable to your future customers. At the end of the ideation phase, you should have a tight and compelling product value proposition that is essentially your foundational idea.

### Part II: Building Your All-Star Team

#### Including Advisors and Mentors
- Founding a business often proves to be the biggest professional challenge most executives undertake, so you will want to build a deep bench of advisors to get you through the extreme highs and lows. After several years that will come in the form of a formal board of directors, but early on it comes in the form of an informal network of prior bosses and mentors, many of whom hopefully become angel investors and advisors as the business takes shape.

### Part III: Have A Clear Business Case

#### Don’t waste your time on a business plan, but do have a tight business case before founding your business
  - You need to develop a sense for all the basics of pricing, costs, and team size to build the business over time. You should use these basics to put together a succinct one- to two-page summary document that you can use for recruiting and financing.

#### Writing your executive summary
- Having a precise executive summary that is no more than two pages is incredibly helpful as you seek advice and pitch your company to investors. In addition to the team and product elements highlighted above that should be major parts of this executive summary, you should also make sure to address the market size, financing strategy, and any customer or revenue traction to date.
- To be a credible venture capital candidate, you’ll need to convince your prospective investors of your large market opportunity. Most investors make between one to three new bets a year, and they hope to make these bets in markets that can contribute to outsized returns. That means that you have to see a path to a large acquisition or an initial public offering (IPO). The best way to evaluate the probability of those outcomes is to calculate an honest review of the total addressable market (TAM). For example, if you are selling to SMB marketers, how many SMB marketers are there in the United States, and how much do they spend on average on marketing software?
- Financing strategy is also important to detail upfront to all prospective investors. Where do you think your first phase of capital is coming from? Some founders build initial prototypes based on capital from their own savings or friends and family investors. Other founders are advised to go straight to the venture community because their ideas have either been validated early in the market or their teams have had past startup success. Regardless of the path you choose, make sure you research how much capital you need and what you will spend it on.

## Founding team pitfalls
- Steve Jobs had a caution about this mode of entrepreneurial decision making: “Follow your heart, but check it with your head.” Before defaulting to the gut, make sure you’ve also engaged the brain. Make sure you’ve thought ahead to the potential consequences of your decision. If the head and heart agree, then terrific: You’re off and running. However, if they disagree, pull back on the reins before you default to what your gut is telling you, for it may be leading you into trouble rather than glory.
- Despite all of the attention paid to product development and market-related issues within startups, among startups that fail, people problems are the leading cause by far, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the failures.
- For founders, the key is to understand ahead of time when they will be making a key people decision and how the options they face could heighten the potential while increasing the risks.
- The most central of those hires is the most important hire a founder might make: his or her successor as CEO, a key inflection point that will be covered in a later chapter but deserves attention here too.

### Found Team Pitfalls: The 3 Rs
- **Relationships**: The most common prior relationships among cofounders are people who knew each other socially but not professionally—most centrally, friends and family. Yet, teams comprised of friends of family are the least stable in the long run.
  - Teams should proactively increase the chances that they will discuss the elephants in room, either by taking to heart the data about team stability and using it to motivate them to reduce their risks together or by tapping a trusted third party to facilitate those conversations. Regarding the second factor, teams should force themselves to list and then prioritize the pitfalls they might face as they grow and create disaster plans for how to deal with them if they occur. If a founder isn’t scaling, how should that be handled? If the two cofounders aren’t agreeing on strategic direction or are fighting at home, which one should exit from the startup?
- **Roles and decision making**: The most common titles taken by founders are C-level titles, and the most common approach to decision making is unanimity or consensus. However, over time, the title inflation comes back to haunt many startups, and the approach to decision making slows down the startup and increases tensions.
  - Attempting to reinforce expectations about roles and decision making can come back to haunt the team. With growth, the team usually realizes the need to adopt a clear hierarchy, to have decisions made by a subset of employees, and often that experienced hires might need to be brought in above the early members of the team. At that point, the deeply ingrained “equals” model is extremely hard to change as people feel left out of key decisions and even demoted.
- **Rewards**: The most common approaches to splitting the most important reward, the equity ownership of the company, heighten the chances that the team will have disincentive to continue fully contributing to the startup and that it will not be able to deal effectively with a cofounder’s leaving the team.
