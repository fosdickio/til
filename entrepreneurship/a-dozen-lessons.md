# Entrepreneurship Lessons

- Innovation helps you stand out, but familiarity helps you engage.
- Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a 10 percent chance of a one hundred–times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten. We all know that if you swing for the fences, you’re going to strike out a lot, but you’re also going to hit some home runs.
- You have to be an independent thinker because you can’t make money agreeing with the consensus view, which is already embedded in the price.
- “A startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.”
- A business model is “the way that a business converts innovation into economic value.”
- A capitalist economy is an evolutionary system. Innovation and best practices are discovered through the experimentation of entrepreneurs who try to establish the evolutionary fitness of their businesses. Products and services that are more fit survive, and the less fit die
- “A company is a permanent organization designed to execute a repeatable and scalable business model.”
  - A business is no longer a startup once it has a repeatable and scalable business model.
- A pessimist sees the danger in every opportunity, but an optimist sees opportunity in every danger.
- The best time to found a business is often in a downturn since employees are easier to recruit, resources are less expensive, and competition is less intense.
- Good judgment tends to come from experience, which tends to come from bad judgment. So failure, while painful, can often have positive benefits
- ‘Build it and they will come’ is not a strategy; it’s a prayer. Founders should first invest five hundred or one thousand hours upfront to be sure that, when they’re done, the business they’re building will face genuine, substantial demand or enthusiasm. Without passionate customers, even the most passionate entrepreneur will flounder at best.
- The company that consistently makes and implements decisions rapidly gains a tremendous, often decisive, competitive advantage.
- Convincing world-class people to join something with as much uncertainty attached to it as a startup is a genuinely valuable skill and optimally the work of a person with missionary zeal. The best venture capitalists know that the first hires are critical so they will often help founders with recruiting, especially at very early stages or with first hires.
